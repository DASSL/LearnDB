# LearnDB
A web front-end to Postgres databases

## Installing and Running Node.JS
LearnDB is run on a Node.JS express web server(tested with LTS Version 10.16.2). To install Node.js and run LearnDB, follow these steps:

1) Install [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Use the installer defaults.
2) Open a command window as administrator
3) Install LearnDB by running the following command from the `src` directory in your clone of this repo: `npm install`
4) Start LearnDB using the following command: `npm start`

By default, the web server listens on `localhost:5000`, unless a different IP address and port are specified in code or in the environment.
